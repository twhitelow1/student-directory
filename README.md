This is my Unit 4 Project for my TreeHouse Full Stack Javascript TechDegree.

This project highlights my ability to create applications that communicate with APIs and work with microservices and databases to build useful tools and relevant infomation quickly and easily.

This is an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

Using the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random "employees" and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

Using the fetch API i request a JSON object from the Random User Generator API and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grib with thier thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee's image or name opens a modal window with more detailed information such as employee's birthday and address. 

The functionality of the gallery and modal window was required to be limited to vanilla javascript and jquery. This is to illustrate that I have knowledge of how things run under the hood of the popular libraries and frameworks available today.
